# Sessions and Server Islands Starter Kit: Basics

This is a demo of Astro's new Sessions feature and cacheable Server Islands
(added in [5.1.6](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/12960)) with an
example of how to make a maximally static full stack web application using
Astro.

This example uses Google Sign in, but should be adaptable to any other auth
provider. This code is a bit coupled to the popup sign in flow, but should be
able to be reworked to handle a redirect flow. PRs welcome!

In order to get started, you'll need to follow the [Create authorization
credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in#create_authorization_credentials)
instructions on this page to get a **Client ID** from Google, and then add
`http://localhost:4321` as an allowed origin.


## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```
